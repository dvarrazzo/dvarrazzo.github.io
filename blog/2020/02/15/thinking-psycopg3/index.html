    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><p>I have been <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/">psycopg2</a> maintainer since 2010; before that, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/commit/4805a935690b1d618247267318a0ef7aa06c2378">git says</a> that my
first contribution was in 2005. At that time, psycopg (one) was the tool to
use, and psycopg2 was an interesting experiment.</p>
<p>In many years of using psycopg2 daily and reading about the expectations,
frustrations, surprises experienced by its users, I have been making my mind
about a better system, and if I had to release a version incompatible with the
past, those are some of the things I would change.</p>
<div class="section" id="adaptation-system">
<h3>Adaptation system</h3>
<p>psycopg2 composes the queries (binding the arguments to the placeholders in
the SQL string) on the client, and sends to the server the complete query with
its values. It does it right, so it doesn't result in SQL injection
vulnerabilities, however the correct way of doing it should be to send the
query and its parameters separately (i.e. using the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-exec.html#LIBPQ-PQEXECPARAMS"><tt class="docutils literal">PQexecParams</tt></a> libpq
function rather than <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-exec.html#LIBPQ-PQEXEC"><tt class="docutils literal">PQexec</tt></a>).</p>
<p>On the pro side, separating the statements is a huge help for the query parser
and saves memory at parsing time. However the behaviour of the library would
change slightly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">PQexecParams</tt> supports only one command at time: it would be no more
possible to send several queries separated by semicolon in a single
<tt class="docutils literal">execute()</tt>.</li>
<li>psycopg2 helps solving some types ambiguities by attaching casts to the
types represented as strings (e.g. the date 1/1/2020 is currently merged to
the query as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'2010-01-01'::date</span></tt>). Using <tt class="docutils literal">PQexecParams</tt> the trick
wouldn't be available anymore (although the type can be specified otherwise
in the query).</li>
<li>Custom-defined adapters should be rewritten.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference between the old adaptation protocol (called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extensions.html#psycopg2.extensions.ISQLQuote"><tt class="docutils literal">ISQLQuote</tt></a>)
and the new one (which doesn't have a name yet, and probably should be
<tt class="docutils literal">ISQL</tt>) is the use of the quotes, whereby the string <tt class="docutils literal">O'Connor</tt> is passed
to the query as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'O''Connor'</span></tt>. In <tt class="docutils literal">ISQL</tt> the string wouldn't undergo the
same transformation to add and escape quotes, and other types would be just
converted into strings in the PostgreSQL syntax, but wouldn't need to be
wrapped in quotes to create a SQL literal. Using <tt class="docutils literal">ISQL</tt> as the fundamental
adaptation steps there would be some interesting improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>adapting composite types and arrays would be a much straightforward matter,</li>
<li>it opens the door to the use of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-exec.html#LIBPQ-PQPREPARE">prepared statements</a>, but especially</li>
<li>the <tt class="docutils literal">COPY FROM</tt> operation could take an iterable object yielding Python
types instead of a file-like object to read; similarly <tt class="docutils literal">COPY TO</tt> could
return an iterable object yielding Python types.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean: this would be great! <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html"><tt class="docutils literal">COPY</tt></a> is by far the most efficient way to
insert data into the database: using it via psycopg2 requires exposing the
data via a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/usage.html#using-copy-to-and-copy-from">file-like object</a>, which not only is a weird interface, but it
requires people to roll their own adaptation format. Looking forward for:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="n">curs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">copy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;COPY song (artist, title) FROM STDIN&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Sinead O'Connor&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'REM'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Losing my Religion&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>
<span class="p">])</span>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="context-managers-and-transactions">
<h3>Context managers and transactions</h3>
<p>psycopg2 follows a de-facto standard (which was <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/db-sig/2012-November/thread.html">widely discussed</a> but never
landed in the DBAPI specs), whereby connections manage a transaction when used
as context manager, by committing/rolling back on <tt class="docutils literal">__exit__</tt>. So the way to
use it would be:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="n">conn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DSN</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># these are two separate transactions</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">do_something_else</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>This is very useful, but it is a surprising behaviour: developers usually
expect an object implementing <tt class="docutils literal">close()</tt> to be closed on context exit (as
files, and even cursors do). It also get in the way of managing different life
cycles on the connection, for instance if there is a pool a connection is
taken from:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">pool</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getconn</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">curs</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">do_someting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">curs</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>it is expected (and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/pull/17">vocally requested</a>) that the connection is returned to the
pool at the end of the block.</p>
<p>Talking about transactions, PostgreSQL support for <tt class="docutils literal">SAVEPOINT</tt> makes
possible to implement nested transactions (already implemented on top of
psycopg2 e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/transactions/#django.db.transaction.atomic">by Django</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/asqui/psycopg-nestedtransactions">in a stand-alone module</a>).</p>
<p>Maybe it would be useful to add an explicit method to start an atomic block
(either a transaction or a savepoint, according to the current connection
state):</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DSN</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transaction</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transaction</span><span class="p">():</span>
            <span class="n">do_something_nested</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transaction</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">tx</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">do_something_else</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="c1"># we were just testing and we don't really want to do this</span>
        <span class="n">tx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rollback</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># and here the connection is closed</span>
</pre>

<h3>Optional C module</h3>
<p>psycopg2 is a C extension module wrapping the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html">libpq</a>, the PostgreSQL client
library. As such, in order to build, it requires a C compiler, Python, and
libpq development packages. It is a relatively low bar, but it can be a pain
nonetheless for several beginner users.</p>
<p>We tried to avoid the problem shipping a <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonwheels.com/">wheel package</a>, but the experience
has been <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=+label%3Awheel">far from being a success</a>,  marred by issues such as the possible
incompatibility between the libcrypto used by Python and by the libpq, the
lack of support for musl libc/Alpine Linux, broken assumptions (like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/305">glibc
breaking backwards compatibility</a>)... There's too magic in that.</p>
<p>Mostly in order to support PyPy, during the years a few &quot;python-only&quot;
implementations have been developed: first a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mvantellingen/psycopg2-ctypes">ctypes implementation</a>, to
which I contributed but which hasn't been maintained at the same feature level
of the C psycopg2. It was further forked into a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chtd/psycopg2cffi">cffi implementation</a>, whose
release numbers don't follow the original ones, which is mighty confusing.</p>
<p>What I think is that psycopg3 should follow an approach similar to PyYAML
(I've seen it doing, I have to check how...), which tries to compile an
optimized version of the library and falls back to a Python implementation if
it fails.</p>
<p>psycopg3 would try to use the C module in preference of the Python module, but
if someone wanted to enforce the use of one specific implementation, an
environment variable could be used for the task, such as
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PSYCOPG3_IMPL={C|PYTHON}</span></tt>, in the presence of which importing the module
would fail in case the requested implementation is not available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-improvements">
<h3>Other improvements</h3>
<p>I've noted some of the ideas to implement in <a class="reference external" href="https://trello.com/b/6tF2oHJ0/psycopg3">a trello board</a> and in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/milestone/4">an
issues milestone</a>. Some of them weren't actually incompatible and ended up
implemented in psycopg2; some will have to wait.</p>
<p>A lot can be done if there is will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an async interface based on <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a> (as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiopg">aiopg</a> offers)</li>
<li>async COPY methods (see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/428">issue #428</a>)</li>
<li>better support for SQL_ASCII databases (which unlike their name are actually
unencoded 8 bits, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/519">issue #519</a>)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/dvarrazzo/3797445">preparing cursors</a></li>
<li>reorganising the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extensions.html">extensions</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extras.html">extras</a> module, which contain an
heterogeneous assortment of objects, functions, constants...</li>
</ul>
<p>I would be interested in starting the development of this project, and would
love to hear what areas should be the focus: I would like some discussion to
happen on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/list/psycopg/">Mailing List</a>, so please <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.postgresql.org/">subscribe</a> and participate!</p>
<p>And if psycopg2 has been useful so far for you and your business and would
love to see a psycopg3 even more performing and easier to use, please consider
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sponsors/dvarrazzo/">sponsoring the development</a>, thank you! 💓</p>
