    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><p>Developing database-backed applications, I've often had the need to extract
a meaningful selection of data from a production database. Maybe to set up a
development environment, or a testing environment, or to try out a complex
migration on smaller data.</p>
<p>However a <tt class="docutils literal">pg_dump</tt> of the production db is not necessarily a good idea:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the production data may be YUGE;</li>
<li>the production data may contain sensitive information;</li>
<li>some of the data in the production db might be bulky and irrelevant, for
instance audit tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, googling around, you don't get much to help: people still advise to use
<tt class="docutils literal">pg_dump</tt> with a plethora of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--table</span></tt>, but this results in the need of
saving a script to keep the unwieldy command line, and still that does not
make you able to modify in any way the data dumped from the table, for
instance to omit the <tt class="docutils literal">password</tt> column. You might use <tt class="docutils literal">COPY TO</tt> for that,
but that's an entirely different beast from <tt class="docutils literal">pg_dump</tt> and the resulting file
is only data: it will bear no context about how it should be restored (now
that you dropped the <tt class="docutils literal">password</tt> column the data won't align anymore for a
trivial <tt class="docutils literal">COPY FROM</tt>...)</p>
<p>A few months ago I decided to scratch the itch properly, and I started writing
an tool that turned out to be <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pg_seldump">pg_seldump</a>. The idea behind the tool is to
define a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a> file with a description of the dumping rule to apply to
different tables. For instance:</p>
<pre class="code YAML literal-block">
<span class="c1"># A YAML file is similar in content to a JSON file, but easier for human</span>
<span class="c1"># to edit: more compact, less noisy, and can be commented.</span>
<span class="nt">db_objects</span><span class="p">:</span>

  <span class="c1"># dump all the tables in the schema 'myapp'</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">schema</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">myapp</span>
    <span class="nt">action</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">dump</span>

  <span class="c1"># but not the one starting with 'audit_'</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">schema</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">myapp</span>
    <span class="nt">names</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;^audit_.*&quot;</span>
    <span class="nt">action</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">skip</span>

  <span class="c1"># don't dump customers passwords, and replace their telephone no. with a dummy</span>
  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">schema</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">myapp</span>
    <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">customer</span>
    <span class="nt">no_columns</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">password</span>
    <span class="nt">replace</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="nt">telephone</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;+44</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">7853</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">123456&quot;</span>
</pre>
<p>The program isn't finished yet, but it is already quite interesting: the
<tt class="docutils literal">pg_seldump</tt> command takes in input one or more configuration files like the
one in the example and introspects the database looking for the objects to
dump. The objects are matched against all the rules and, inspired to CSS, it
picks the one with the highest selectivity. It also understand what fields use
what sequences, and if the field is dumped the sequence will be saved as well.</p>
<p>There is one large feature I'm about to develop: automatically navigating
foreign keys in order to collect all the data necessary to create a consistent
sample of the data. I started yesterday working at that feature, but
there is something else I wanted to do before...</p>
<div class="section" id="what-s-into-a-configuration-file">
<h3>What's into a configuration file?</h3>
<p>So far, the program had a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pg_seldump/blob/96c811b272130d7492c62ba89216ab537dbd4d41/seldump/dumprule.py#L103">parser for the configuration file</a> to create
&quot;rule&quot; objects out of what found in the YAML. While it works, it's quite
verbose, it stops at the first error, and it's hard to understand from it what
is really allowed in the file. I find working with unstructured data really
impractical: every single property is optional, every typo (<tt class="docutils literal">schmea</tt>) should
be explicitly checked.</p>
<p>In order to check the configuration entirely before throwing it into the rest
of the program, and in order to be able to document precisely what is a valid
configuration file, I've taken a look at <a class="reference external" href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>. Now, that's
deceiving: validating YAML with JSON Schema? That turns out to be no problem,
because the validation doesn't happen at syntactical level, but it is
performed on the objects after parsing. Limiting the YAML to the same data
types JSON can handle it will work no problem.</p>
<p>JSON Schemas are quite simple to define: it didn't take too long to put
together a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pg_seldump/blob/eae1d8634444b0fd1bfeff4f75f89116a975b736/seldump/schema/config.yaml">schema for pg_seldump configuration file</a> (in YAML of course).
However, performing validation (using the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/jsonschema/">jsonschema</a> Python package) the
results are not entirely satisfactory. For instance, this is a configuration
file containing 4 errors:</p>
<pre class="code YAML literal-block">
<span class="ln">1 </span><span class="c1"># badconfig.yaml</span>
<span class="ln">2 </span><span class="nt">db_objects</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="ln">3 </span>  <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="nt">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">10</span>
<span class="ln">4 </span>    <span class="nt">adjust_score</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">a</span>
<span class="ln">5 </span>    <span class="nt">kind</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">wat</span>
<span class="ln">6 </span>    <span class="nt">action</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">trip</span>
</pre>
<p>It can be easily validated against the schema:</p>
<pre class="code pycon literal-block">

<span class="go">10 is not of type 'string'
'wat' is not one of ['table', 'sequence', 'partitioned table', 'materialized view']
'a' is not of type 'integer'
'trip' is not one of ['dump', 'skip', 'error']</span>
</pre>
<p>However these error messages, as informative as they can be, have lost the
context of where they originated. Sure 10 is not a string, but good luck
finding the right &quot;10&quot; into a large file. The problem comes from that same
characteristic that allowed us to validate a YAML file against a JSON schema
expressed in a YAML file: everything is based on Python plain objects
(scalars, dicts, lists) and the information of what line in what file that
value came from is long lost.</p>
<p>In order to overcome the problem, the idea is to attach these information,
available at parsing time, to the parsed objects. In a previous approximation
of the solution I had <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pg_seldump/blob/96c811b272130d7492c62ba89216ab537dbd4d41/seldump/yaml.py">only the dictionaries</a> &quot;decorated&quot; with their
position. In case of error the name of the file and the first line of the
dictionary would have been printed: better than nothing I guess, but not
perfect (in the above example any error would have been reported at line 3).</p>
<p>With the introduction of the JSON schema validator I got back on the
customized yaml parser. First I used more hooks to memorize the position of
lists and scalar types too. The scalars themselves don't remember the
attribute they are attached to: that <tt class="docutils literal">10</tt> above knows it's at line 3, but
not that it was the tentative <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> of an object. So the idea was to
further instrument the dictionaries returned by YAML and memorize, item by
item, what line the value was parsed from. When a schema validation error is
found, <tt class="docutils literal">jsonschema</tt> errors have an useful <tt class="docutils literal">path</tt> attribute describing in
what object the error was found. So, if the last element is a string and the
penultimate is a dictionary, there is enough information to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dvarrazzo/pg_seldump/blob/eae1d8634444b0fd1bfeff4f75f89116a975b736/seldump/config.py#L135-L167">associate it back
to the original file and position</a>.</p>
<p>The result I think is very user friendly:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ pg_seldump --test badconfig.yaml
ERROR at badconfig.yaml:3: name: 10 is not of type 'string'
ERROR at badconfig.yaml:5: kind: 'wat' is not one of ['table', 'sequence', 'partitioned table', view']
ERROR at badconfig.yaml:4: adjust_score: 'a' is not of type 'integer'
ERROR at badconfig.yaml:6: action: 'trip' is not one of ['dump', 'skip', 'error']
</pre>
<p>Interesting that the errors are not in line order: I'll try and sort them.
Also, it wasn't possible to express everything in the JSON schema: demanding
at most one between <tt class="docutils literal">name</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">names</tt> for each object seems quite
difficult and I don't think there exist a regular expression to state that
<tt class="docutils literal">names</tt> must be a valid regular expression, so certain things are still
demanded to a step after validation. However, emitting all the errors in one
go and the precise location of where they occur was a good usability step.
This is a program I would like to use.</p>
<p>Looking forward to diving into graph traversal matters to gather the set of
all the records recursively referred by the selected records, and the
recursive queries to generate them...</p>
