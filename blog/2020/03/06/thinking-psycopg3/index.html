  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2"><p>I have been <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/">psycopg2</a> maintainer since 2010; before that, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/commit/4805a935690b1d618247267318a0ef7aa06c2378">git says</a> that my
first contribution was in 2005. At that time, psycopg (one) was the tool to
use, and psycopg2 was an interesting experiment.</p>
<p>In several years of using psycopg2 daily and reading about expectations,
frustrations, surprises experienced by other users, I have been making my mind
about a better system, and if I had to release a version incompatible with the
past, those are some of the things I would change.</p>
<div class="section" id="query-parameters-adaptation">
<h3>Query parameters adaptation</h3>
<p>psycopg2 composes queries (replacing the placeholders in the SQL strings with
the values supplied by the user) on the client, and sends a complete query to
the server.</p>
<img alt="Sequence diagram for psycopg2" class="mb10 align-center" src="seq-psycopg2.jpg" />
<p>It does its job right, so it doesn't result in SQL injection vulnerabilities.
However the correct way of doing it, as far as PostgreSQL is concerned, should
be to send the query and its parameters separately (i.e. using the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-exec.html#LIBPQ-PQEXECPARAMS"><tt class="docutils literal">PQexecParams</tt></a> libpq function rather than <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-exec.html#LIBPQ-PQEXEC"><tt class="docutils literal">PQexec</tt></a>).</p>
<img alt="Sequence diagram for psycopg3" class="mb10 align-center" src="seq-psycopg3.jpg" />
<p>Separating the statement from the parameters improves performance and memory
usage at parsing time. However the behaviour of the library would change
slightly, which is the reason why server-side merging hasn't been used so far.
For instance:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">PQexecParams</tt> only supports one command at time: it wouldn't be possible
anymore to send a batch of queries separated by semicolon in a single
<tt class="docutils literal">execute()</tt> call.</li>
<li>psycopg2 helps solving some type casting ambiguities by attaching casts to
the types represented as strings (e.g. the date 1/1/2020 is currently merged
to the query as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'2010-01-01'::date</span></tt>); using <tt class="docutils literal">PQexecParams</tt> the trick
wouldn't be available anymore. It might be possible maybe to suggest the
type in other ways, but if that's not the case then queries should be
modified by applying explicit casts next to their placeholders (e.g.
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">%s::date</span></tt>).</li>
<li>Custom-defined adapters should be rewritten.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference between the old adaptation protocol (called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extensions.html#psycopg2.extensions.ISQLQuote"><tt class="docutils literal">ISQLQuote</tt></a>)
and the new one (which doesn't have a name yet, it could be probably called
<tt class="docutils literal">ISQL</tt>) is the use of the quotes, whereby the string <tt class="docutils literal">O'Connor</tt> is passed
to the query as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'O''Connor'</span></tt>, with wrapping quotes and doubled-up quotes in
the content. In <tt class="docutils literal">ISQL</tt> the string wouldn't undergo the same transformation
to add and escape quotes; other types would only have to be converted into
strings in the PostgreSQL syntax, but wouldn't need to be wrapped in quotes to
create a SQL literal. Using <tt class="docutils literal">ISQL</tt> as the fundamental adaptation steps there
would be some interesting improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>adapting composite types and arrays would be a much more straightforward
matter,</li>
<li>it opens the door to the use of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-exec.html#LIBPQ-PQPREPARE">prepared statements</a>, but especially</li>
<li>the <tt class="docutils literal">COPY FROM</tt> operation could take an iterable object yielding Python
types instead of a file-like object to read; similarly <tt class="docutils literal">COPY TO</tt> could
return an iterable object yielding Python types.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mean: this would be great! <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html"><tt class="docutils literal">COPY</tt></a> is by far the most efficient way to
insert data into the database: using it via psycopg2 requires exposing the
data via a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/usage.html#using-copy-to-and-copy-from">file-like object</a>, which not only is a weird interface, but it
requires people to roll their own adaptation format. The target for copying
data into the database using psycopg3 should be as easy as:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="n">curs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">copy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;COPY song (artist, title) FROM STDIN&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Sinead O'Connor&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Nothing Compares 2 U&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'REM'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Losing my Religion&quot;</span><span class="p">),</span>
<span class="p">])</span>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="context-managers-and-transactions">
<h3>Context managers and transactions</h3>
<p>psycopg2 follows a de-facto standard (which was <a class="reference external" href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/db-sig/2012-November/thread.html">widely discussed</a> but which
never landed in the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/">DBAPI specs</a>), whereby connections used as context
managers wrap a transaction, committing it if exiting on success or rolling it
back in case of error. So the way to use it is something like:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="n">conn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DSN</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># these are two separate transactions</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">do_something_else</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>This idea has its usefulness,  but it is a <em>very</em> surprising behaviour:
developers usually expect the same resources released by <tt class="docutils literal">close()</tt> to be
released on context exit (as files, sockets, and even DBAPI cursors do). It
also gets in the way of managing different life cycles on the connection, for
instance if there is the connection is taken from a pool:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">pool</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getconn</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">curs</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">do_someting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">curs</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>then it is expected (and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/pull/17">reasonably requested</a>) that the connection is
returned to the pool at the end of the block.</p>
<p>Talking about transactions, PostgreSQL support for <tt class="docutils literal">SAVEPOINT</tt> makes
possible to implement nested transactions (already implemented on top of
psycopg2 e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/transactions/#django.db.transaction.atomic">by Django</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/asqui/psycopg-nestedtransactions">in a stand-alone module</a>). This seems to
ask for a different context than the connection-scope one. So maybe it would
be useful to leave the latter to the management of the resource, releasing
them on connection context exit, and to add an explicit method to start an
atomic block (either a transaction or a savepoint, according to the current
connection state):</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">DSN</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transaction</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">do_something</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transaction</span><span class="p">():</span>
            <span class="n">do_something_nested</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">transaction</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">tx</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">do_something_else</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="c1"># we were just testing and we don't really want to do this</span>
        <span class="n">tx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">rollback</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># and here the connection is closed</span>

<h3>Optional C module</h3>
<p>psycopg2 is a C extension module wrapping the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html">libpq</a>, the PostgreSQL client
library. As such, in order to build, it requires a C compiler, Python, and
libpq development packages. It is a relatively low bar, but it can be a pain
nonetheless for beginner users.</p>
<p>We tried to avoid the problem by shipping a <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonwheels.com/">wheel package</a>, but the
experience has been <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=+label%3Awheel">far from being a success</a>,  marred by diverse issues
such as the possible incompatibility between the libcrypto used by Python and
by the libpq, the lack of support for musl libc/Alpine Linux (much in demand
in Docker images), broken assumptions (like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/305">glibc breaking backwards
compatibility</a>)... There's just too much magic needed to work smoothly.</p>
<p>In the past years, mostly in order to support <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pypy.org/">PyPy</a>, a few &quot;python-only&quot;
psycopg2 implementations have been developed: first a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mvantellingen/psycopg2-ctypes">ctypes
implementation</a>, to which I contributed but which hasn't been maintained at
the same feature level of the reference C psycopg2. This package was further
forked into a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chtd/psycopg2cffi">cffi implementation</a>, which seems to be more active, but
whose release numbers don't follow the original ones, which is mighty
confusing.</p>
<p>psycopg3 might follow an approach I've seen used in other extension modules
such as PyYAML, which try to compile an optimized version of the library and
fall back to a Python implementation if that fails. Using the C module over
the Python module would be a preference at import time, but if could still be
possible to enforce the use of one specific implementation, for instance using
a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PSYCOPG3_IMPL={C|PYTHON}</span></tt> environment variable, which would make the lack
of the requested implementation an import time error.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="async-from-the-ground-up">
<h3>Async from the ground up</h3>
<p>The DBAPI interface is synchronous and blocking by design: <tt class="docutils literal">connect()</tt>
blocks until a connection is open, <tt class="docutils literal">execute()</tt> blocks until the query is
completed etc. This didn't stop psycopg2 to work asynchronously, exposing two
different interfaces for it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/advanced.html#asynchronous-support">a purely asynchronous one</a> where the application must explicitly
<tt class="docutils literal">poll()</tt> to bring forward the connection/execution process: it breaks the
DBAPI interface but allows frameworks who can't make blocking calls anyway
(such as the revered <a class="reference external" href="https://twistedmatrix.com/">Twisted</a>) to use it;</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/advanced.html#support-for-coroutine-libraries">a coroutine-based one</a> where the DBAPI blocking interface is respected
but behind the scene psycopg2 collaborates with coroutine libraries such as
<a class="reference external" href="https://eventlet.net/">Eventlet</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gevent.org/">gevent</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, the world has gone forward, and Python now offers core
support in its syntax and library to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a>: this is the foundation that
newer Python async frameworks, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/">aiohttp</a>, are built upon. A third-part
wrapper, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiopg">aiopg</a>, currently helps to bridge the async mode of psycopg2 with the
asyncio machinery, but of course there is some overhead, mostly caused by the
fact that the C implementation of psycopg2 is a relatively thick layer, with
the libpq async calls deeply buried under the C implementation of the Python
<tt class="docutils literal">connection</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">cursor</tt> objects and behind their interfaces.</p>
<p>There is a chance now to rethink how thick the C libpq wrapper should be. We
can reduce the C implementation to a minimal wrapper around the libpq
(replaceable by a CFFI Python wrapper if compiling C is not available on the
client), using it as a foundation to build a familiar DBAPI blocking
interface. A blocking behaviour is not bad in itself: it allows to write most
of the programs, the ones which don't need crazy concurrency, in a simple and
familiar paradigm; the async layer would be available under the hood to
squeeze the best performance in programs who have embraced an asynchronous
pattern and framework. Time for a picture:</p>

<h3>Other improvements</h3>
<p>I've written down some of the ideas to implement on <a class="reference external" href="https://trello.com/b/6tF2oHJ0/psycopg3">a Trello board</a> and in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/milestone/4">an issues milestone</a>. As the board shows, some of the improvements weren't
actually incompatible with psycopg2 and over the years they have already
landed in in its releases; some other ones will have to wait.</p>
<p>Some of what could be improved over psycopg2:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">async COPY methods (see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/428">issue #428</a>);</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">better support for SQL_ASCII databases (which, unlike what their name
suggests, are actually unencoded 8 bits, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/519">issue #519</a>);</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/dvarrazzo/3797445">preparing cursors</a>;</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">return value on <tt class="docutils literal">execute()</tt>:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">record</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">cur</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">connection and cursor-scoped adapters (currently you can scope the
adaptation rules from Postgres to Python but the rules from Python to
Postgres can only be global);</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">reorganising the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extensions.html">extensions</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extras.html">extras</a> module, which at the moment contain
an heterogeneous assortment of objects, functions, constants...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I would be interested in starting the development of this project soon. If you
have opinions, or interest in the project, please let us know on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/list/psycopg/">Mailing
List</a> (you can <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.postgresql.org/">subscribe here</a>).</p>
<p>...and if psycopg2 has been useful so far for you and for your business and
would love to see a psycopg3 even more performing and easier to use, please
consider <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sponsors/dvarrazzo/">sponsoring the development</a>, thank you! 💜</p>
