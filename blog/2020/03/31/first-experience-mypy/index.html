prominently.</p>
<p>For those who are not aware, Mypy is a <em>static checker for Python</em>. The idea
is to annotate Python objects and functions with indications about what type
an object can be (a string, an &quot;integer or None&quot;, etc.). You can then run a
checker on the codebase and it will warn you about wrong type usage. At
runtime nothing change: Python is still Python, not another language, and the
type annotations are just ignored.</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greeting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">str</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">'Hello '</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">name</span>
</pre>
<p>It's like using a language less flexible than Python, but it still runs as slow
as Python, because it's not compiled. Ehm... the worst of two world? ðŸ˜¬</p>
<p>So, why people do it? Well, people do weird things. But the idea behind it is
that there is a certain class of bugs that Mypy checker would catch. The lack
of type checking in Python is at the heart of its philosophy (<em>duck typing</em>
and all that stuff). On the other hand many people, and I amongst them, can be
nervous in putting in production code with little formal assurance about its
correctness. My personal way to cope with the uneasiness of a language without
compiler is to resort to write unit tests. Frameworks like <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pytest.org/">pytest</a> make
writing and running tests a joy, reducing to almost zero the need of fiddling
interactively into an interactive console while developing. I also find that
writing tests before writing the code they are supposed to test helps in
thinking what do you want your code to look like and to design more usable
interfaces.</p>
<p>So, big proposer of TDD here, stressing on the second D because writing test
while you develop can actually happen and is useful; writing &quot;the program now,
the tests later&quot; can be dismissed with a laugh: I have <em>never</em> seen that
happening.</p>
<p>As I started writing <a class="reference external" href="/blog/2020/03/26/psycopg3-first-report/">psycopg3</a>, tests have
been committed together with the code and, on a codebase of less than 3000
lines of code, there are already some 150 of them. They get written to help
with development but they are also run at every commit <a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/psycopg/psycopg3">on Travis CI</a>,
making sure that changes in the code don't introduce breakage in any of the
supported versions of Python (from 3.6 to 3.8) and PostgreSQL (from 9.5 to
12).</p>
<p>While this is a strong position from which to say &quot;who needs a compiler?&quot; and
to laugh smugly at developers over-relying on a compiler and tripping in
<tt class="docutils literal">java.lang.NullPointerException</tt>s I don't think being complacent is any
useful for the quality of a codebase, or of a person for what matters. And if
so much research is being done on the Python objects model it surely deserves
a look.</p>
<p>Just running <tt class="docutils literal">mypy</tt> on the whole codebase produces little of interest.
Running <tt class="docutils literal">mypy <span class="pre">--strict</span></tt> is a different story, because it is expected every
function to be annotated. I started at a 250 errors mark:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(env) piro&#64;makkuro:~/dev/psycopg3$ mypy --strict psycopg3
psycopg3/exceptions.py:35: error: Function is missing a type annotation

</pre>
<p>Fast forward 6 hours of hacking, not solid but surely intense and:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
(env) piro&#64;makkuro:~/dev/psycopg3$ mypy --strict psycopg3
Success: no issues found in 21 source files
</pre>
<p>What did I learn from the experience?</p>
<div class="section" id="the-changes">
<h3>The changes</h3>
<p>In all its glory, this is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg3/compare/f9884ab...474483e?expand=1">the whole changeset</a> to go from no type to a clean
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--strict</span></tt> pass.</p>
<p>It's a whopping 794 additions and 365 deletions, which is a relevant amount of
changes for a codebase of less than 3000 lines. What was that for? Here are
some of the changes I ended up making, and some observations about them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="local-and-class-variables">
<h3>Local and class variables</h3>
<p>You don't have to annotate every single variable: the types are inferred
automatically. But when things cannot be inferred from the first value assumed
by a variable it is necessary to add a type. That's fair.</p>
<pre class="code diff literal-block">
  def _reset(self) -&gt; None:
<span class="gd">-     self._results = []
-     self._result = None
</span><span class="gi">+     self._results: List[PGresult] = []
+     self._result: Optional[PGresult] = None</span>
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="out-of-domain-values">
<h3>Out-of-domain values</h3>
<p>A type of change I wasn't especially keen on initially was in situations like:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="n">ready</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">None</span>

<span class="k">while</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">something_happens</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">ready</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Ready</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">R</span>
    <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">ready</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Ready</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">W</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">we_have_done</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ready</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">break</span>
</pre>
<p>Mypy would complain along the lines of:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Argument 1 to &quot;<strong>we_have_done</strong>&quot; has incompatible type &quot;<strong>Optional[Ready]</strong>&quot;; expected &quot;<strong>Ready</strong>&quot;
</pre>
<p>Uhm. In my book a <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> will never reach <tt class="docutils literal">we_have_done()</tt>. However go
tell the analyzer. In order to make the checker happy I changed the above
to:</p>
<pre class="code diff literal-block">
<span class="gd">- ready = None
</span><span class="gi">+ ready = Ready.R</span>
</pre>
<p>which is not something that made me happy. It gives the wrong idea that the
initial <tt class="docutils literal">Ready.R</tt> state is actually meaningful, when all it means instead is
&quot;shut up, Mypy&quot;. Only later it occurred to me that a better fix is probably:</p>
<pre class="code diff literal-block">
<span class="gd">- ready = None
</span><span class="gi">+ ready: Ready</span>
</pre>
<p>meaning that the type is declared although it doesn't have a value yet. In
case a later refactoring was botched, the code would explode here, with a
<tt class="docutils literal">NameError</tt> in this function, where the bug actually is, rather than
somewhere in the depths of the innocent <tt class="docutils literal">we_have_done()</tt>. So I think this is
a positive change, bringing a possible manifestation of an error closer to its
cause.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="too-creative-decorators">
<h3>Too creative decorators?</h3>
<p>Adaptation of Python objects to PostgreSQL types happens via adapters, for
which I'm toying with various choices to make them easy to define, easier than
what it is in psycopg2 and covering tricky corner cases more naturally. In
one way or another, the need is to store in a registry the association from a
Python <tt class="docutils literal">type</tt> to an adapter object, let's say a function for simplicity.</p>
<p>In the form I had when I started introducing types, a static method
<tt class="docutils literal">Adapter.register()</tt> could be used in both ways: as a function, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">adapt_number</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>

<span class="n">Adapter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">register</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">adapt_number</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>or as a decorator:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="nd">&#64;Adapter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">register</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">adapt_number</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre>
<p>both are useful in different situations: the former is useful when defining or
registering the adapter at import time is not convenient, the latter is a
matter of convenience, as all decorators are.</p>
<p>But what's the price of this convenience? In this implementation the function
has a signature of the likes of <tt class="docutils literal">Adapt.register(</tt><em>type</em><tt class="docutils literal">,</tt><em>obj</em><tt class="docutils literal">=None)</tt>, behaving in radically different ways according to whether <em>obj</em> is
<tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> or not. If it's not <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> (the function call case) then it
registers the function and it doesn't have to return anything; if it's
<tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>  then it returns a decorator function that will take the object
<em>obj</em>, do its registration thing, and return it unchanged.</p>
<p>Now, that's a pretty complicated signature. It can still be done - at least
defining the return value, not attaching it to the nullness of the second
argument. But... is it worth? If this function is so complicated to describe,
maybe the request of asking what type it is just makes this complexity to
stand in its ugliness. Instead of insisting on the original idea and fighting
Mypy to craft an overly complicated return value, splitting it into two
simpler functions seemed to me the right choice. Now <tt class="docutils literal">register()</tt>'s second
argument is no more optional and its return value is always <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>; the
decorator is just a separate method.</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="c1"># The function is called one way</span>
<span class="n">Adapter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">register</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">adapt_number</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># The decorator another way</span>
<span class="nd">&#64;Adapter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">int</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># can be 'text()' or 'binary()'</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">adapt_number</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre>
<p>It also makes sense from the naming point of view: <tt class="docutils literal">register()</tt> is an active
verb, <tt class="docutils literal">text</tt> is a sort of declaration. The function can expose other
optional arguments, for instance a scope where to register the adapter,
whereas the decorator couldn't make use of them. They are two functions
instead of one, but each one does only one thing, and with fewer parameters.</p>
<p>I hate when a program tells me my design is wrong. But maybe it has a point.
Complicating the design for syntactic sugar maybe is not a healthy thing to do
(it <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7205613-syntactic-sugar-causes-cancer-of-the-semicolon">causes cancer of the semicolon</a> someone said...)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ctypes-integration">
<h3>ctypes integration</h3>
<p>ctypes allows to bind to C functions defined in external libraries and it has
its  types annotation and automatic conversion to Python (or to segfault if
you get it wrong).</p>
<p>Mypy doesn't know much about it, so even in a simple case such as:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="c1"># ctypes wrapper</span>
<span class="n">PQhost</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pq</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">PQhost</span>
<span class="n">PQhost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">argtypes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">PGconn_ptr</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">PQhost</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">restype</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c_char_p</span>

<span class="c1"># later on, a wrapper object</span>
<span class="nd">&#64;property</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">host</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">bytes</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">PQhost</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pgconn_ptr</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>it will complain of</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Returning <strong>Any</strong> from function declared to return &quot;<strong>bytes</strong>&quot;
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately <tt class="docutils literal">PQhost</tt> is a callable object, not a function, and it's of the
same type of all the other functions with different signatures, so it cannot
be annotated.</p>
<p>What helped in this situation was to define a <a class="reference external" href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubs.html">stub</a>, which is a <tt class="docutils literal">.pyi</tt> file
containing only the types and no definition, and it is the mechanism to add
annotations to stuff that is not pure Python code; in this case:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">PQhost</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Optional</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">PGconn_struct</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="nb">bytes</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">...</span>
</pre>
<p>Writing a stub to pretend that those callables are functions is simple enough.
What is painful is having to define all the signatures pretty much twice:
error prone and numbingly boring. This calls for the mythical lazy programmer
which, given a boring task, writes a program to do it for them. It's simple
enough to write a script inspecting the module containing the ctypes
definition and generating the repetitive part of the stub, leaving to write
manually only the delicate cases (e.g. to disambiguate between a pointer and
an array): if you find it useful you can find the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg3/blob/474483ed223a28f867e9d2f220ce6d6c6a4fd11c/psycopg3/pq/_pq_ctypes.py#L419">interface generator</a> in
this function, and here is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg3/blob/474483ed223a28f867e9d2f220ce6d6c6a4fd11c/psycopg3/pq/_pq_ctypes.pyi#L43">the stub generated</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="it-found-two-bugs">
<h3>It found two bugs!</h3>
<p>Most of my time was spent adding types to every function. A bit of refactoring
here and there to remove variables reuse etc. A lot was spent learning how to
use the whole thing. But apart from complaining about the lack of signatures,
two errors reported by Mypy were actual bugs.</p>
<p>One was with the choice of the codec to use. There is a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg3/blob/474483ed223a28f867e9d2f220ce6d6c6a4fd11c/psycopg3/pq/encodings.py">map of encodings</a>
from Postgres names to Python names which we use to convert the connection
encoding to a Python codec. Some of the Postgres encodings are unknown to
Python, and SQL_ASCII is a bit special (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/multibyte.html">it actually means &quot;no encoding&quot;</a>)
and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2/issues/519">it needs to be special-cased</a> when reading from the db, so I left it as
<tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> in the encodings map.</p>
<p>But because of that <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> my code was wrong:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="c1"># for unknown encodings and SQL_ASCII be strict and use ascii</span>
<span class="n">pyenc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pq</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">py_codecs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pgenc</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ascii&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">_codec</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">codecs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lookup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">pyenc</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>This bit of code wanted to deal both with a missing encoding and with
SQL_ASCII, but it does it wrong. If <tt class="docutils literal">pgenc</tt> is <tt class="docutils literal">None</tt> then <tt class="docutils literal">pyenc</tt> is
<tt class="docutils literal">None</tt>, not <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;ascii&quot;</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">codecs.lookup()</tt> will go boom. What the
above really needs to be is more:</p>
<pre class="code diff literal-block">
 # for unknown encodings and SQL_ASCII be strict and use ascii
<span class="gd">- pyenc = pq.py_codecs.get(pgenc, &quot;ascii&quot;)
</span><span class="gi">+ pyenc = pq.py_codecs.get(pgenc) or &quot;ascii&quot;
</span> self._codec = codecs.lookup(pyenc)
</pre>
<p>Another bug was a pasto: every connection and every cursor have two mappings:
<tt class="docutils literal">adapters</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">casters</tt> to customize the conversions respectively to and
from the database, and there are global mappings as a fallback. Sure enough I
copypasted some of it, and sure enough I forgot to change a bit:</p>
<pre class="code diff literal-block">
<span class="gd">- where = context.adapters if context is not None else Typecaster.globals
</span><span class="gi">+ where = context.casters if context is not None else Typecaster.globals
</span>  where[oid, format] = caster
  return caster
</pre>
<p>But because I had added something similar to the following definitions:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Typecaster</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="nb">globals</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Dict</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Tuple</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">Oid</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Format</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">TypecasterFunc</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>

<p>the type system couldn't find a type for <tt class="docutils literal">where</tt> to reconcile the two sides
of the <tt class="docutils literal">if</tt>: even if both values are dicts they won't contain the same
types.</p>
<p>Now, I can find plenty of excuses to justify these two errors: they were in a
part of the codebase still stubbed out because it's a design phase and tests
for them are not written yet (at the moment there are only two adapters, for
string and numbers, just to play with the whole adaptation stack). I'm sure
tests finding the issues would have been added later during development. But
my excuses don't change an important matter: those bugs were there. In TDD, if
you don't have a test, you don't have anything: your program is wrong pretty
much by definition.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>What I have experienced is that most people say &quot;tests are useful&quot;, usually
followed by &quot;but we don't have time to write them&quot;. Or something funny like
&quot;let's write this quickly and release, then we'll write the tests&quot;.</p>
<p>If this is the case Mypy can actually be quite useful: adding types is a quick
matter once you have familiarity with the type system and if you annotate as
the code as you write it instead of, as I did, as a second pass. It's easy to
run Mypy in CI and make sure the program still &quot;compiles ok&quot;. You can make
sure that a whole program is completely type-checked much more easily than to
make sure there are enough tests (no, code-coverage is no such a measure).</p>
<p>Is Mypy enough to be confident about a program's behaviour? Not at all, not in
my book, as much as bugs do exist in compiled programs - boy if exist.
Mypy+pytest is a great team though: they pretty much complement each other,
one giving a shred of a sort of formal proof that what you wrote is
consistent, the other helping to deal with testing things for real.</p>
<p>Is the extra time spent writing annotation and wrestling the type system a
good investment? I think in itself you can dismiss the use of Mypy only if
your test-writing practice is between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;obsessive&quot;. But if you also
factor in other side effects such as having to think harder about types and
functions interfaces, having the signatures as part of the documentation
(<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">&quot;show me your tables...&quot;</a>), then the benefits start stacking up and I
think it makes the use of Mypy quite compelling.</p>
<p>After my annotation marathon I have been thinking for a while if it was worth:
I did it as an experiment, giving myself the option to abandon that branch,
because I've only started with this project and I don't want annotating to
become a time sink as the codebase grow. But I think writing down this
write-up helped me clarifying my ideas about Mypy, and I think it will stay
here and be a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--strict</span></tt> part of psycopg3.</p>
<p>Bud now, please, just go and write those tests.</p>
